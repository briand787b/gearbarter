# GearBarter

### Exchange your gear for other gear

As of right now, this project is mainly to develop and demonstrate my development skills.  This project is the backen API and will receive a mobile front end in the near future (Android) as well as a web front end later on (React)

## How to install on your machine 
###Current Environment
**Postgres** 	9.6
**Go** 		1.9

###Installation Process
Install go 1.9+

Install postgres version 9.6

Create database credentials file
```
{
    "username": "briand787b",
    "password": "password123",
    "database": "gearbarter"
}
```
This file is not checked into source control on purpose.  I am providing it here so that the structure is defined with dummy data.  The `database` field holds the name of the database
